<p>It is important to maintain and enhance your system periodically  to serve the changing needs of your business. The role that upgrades play in adding new functionality, improving business processes, can be critical to the success of your business. At Abel we suggest our clients need to plan for periodic updates just to ensure the reliability of mission-critical applications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To ensure success of an upgrade, here are some areas to consider:</p>
<ul><li>Be sure to define the strategy and timing for ERP upgrades â€“ the 'hows' and 'whys' and 'whens' as it were.</li>
<li>Get support, build consensus and communicate your  ERP strategy. Let stakeholders know what going on so you can build consensus and get the team on board.</li>
<li>Consider the internal and external  resources required for the upgrade </li>
<li>Create a project plan for a successful upgrade with a basic timeline and a set of measurement criteria for your organization.</li>
<li>Make sure that training is incorporated as part of the upgrade so that all new functionality is understood and can be effectively utilized by your team</li>
</ul>
<p>If you consider these issues it will probably mean that completing upgrades will be relatively straight forward with little disruption to your organization while significantly upgrading your systems functionality.</p>
