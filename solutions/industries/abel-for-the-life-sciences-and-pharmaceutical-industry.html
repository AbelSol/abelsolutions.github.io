    <p>Life sciences and pharmaceutical manufacturers handle active ingredients that are often very expensive in small quantities so they are often reused and/or recycled several times. Abel ERP software models the processing and reprocessing of such materials. It also helps minimize over-runs and short-runs, and uses shelf-life tracking to take expiration dates into consideration during production and into the distribution process. You can also centrally manage co-products and by-products in your formulas or recipes and always know the correct inventory status for any given item.</p></div>
