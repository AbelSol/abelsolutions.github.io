    <p>Abel ERP allows you to manage effectively&nbsp; where an issue of contamination arises, and a recall is required. Where traceability has been closely adhered to, it is possible to identify, by precise date/time &amp; exact location which goods must be recalled, and which are safe, potentially saving millions of dollars in the recall process. Traceability within the food processing industry is also utilized to identify key high production &amp; quality areas of a business, versus those of low return, and where points in the production process may be improved.</p>
