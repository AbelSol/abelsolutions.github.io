<div class="inner"><h1>Origins</h1>
<p>In the late 1990's, Allan Baird the founder of Abel Software had a vision that manufacturing companies would be dedicated to continuous improvement and customer satisfaction. This was the premise of developing Abel ERP which enables growing business the flexibility and control to achieve their potential.&nbsp; Abel Solutions traces its origins back to 2000 when its owner and founder David Mills identified the Abel ERP overcame the constraints that traditional accounting and financial software packages imposed on organizations. Abel ERP placed control back into the hands of business owners allowing them to build the software to align with their preferred and optimal business process.</p>
<p> Over the years the team at Abel have identified that for the New Zealand economy to achieve its potential it had to export and to export it required the broad base of New Zealand SMEs to get larger and improve their systems and processes through embracing technology.</p>

<p>Building a strong foundation has been the primary objective of the organization both in service offering and organizational structure. To that end our client portfolio has evolved to become a global set of businesses. Today, Abel Solutions is a  technology leader that designs, manufactures, and markets ERP Services to professional, industrial, and commercial customers.
