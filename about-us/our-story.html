                <p>Abel Software began developing their ERP system in 1996 with one single-minded objective: to provide medium-sized companies with serious ERP functionality without the associated complexity, cost and maintenance burdens of systems developed
                    for very large organizations.</p>
                <p>To meet the business sector’s needs, the Abel software has been designed from the ground up to be highly flexible. This fully integrated system – linking financial, manufacturing and production, distribution, inventory, customer and supplier
                    management systems – also uniquely allows you to “light up” only the functionalities you actually need to use. This saves costs and allows for inbuilt easy scalability, enabling you to progressively switch on new functionality as your
                    business grows without facing further installation headaches and costs.</p>
                <p>Abel has established a prized reputation for simplicity of use and reliability. It is designed to be run by your staff, not by external IT support teams. As the needs of our customers continue to change, we are committed to continually
                    bringing out new features to meet these needs of a constantly changing commercial world.</p>
                <p>We provide highly competitive one-time or monthly licensing options that save you from the big upfront fees charged by other system suppliers. Full support and training is provided by Abel Solutions. Because our system is user-friendly
                    and intuitive you can expect your staff to quickly find their way around Abel without requiring intensive training time.</p>
                <p>We are aggressively pursuing our goal to build an outstanding team, a high quality service and a sustainable business model achieving superior and sustainable financial results. That's our vision of the future - the vision we're aggressively
