    <h2>Better decision-making through Product Lifecycle Intelligence with Abel PLM</h2>
    <p>Given rising time and cost pressures, understanding the true impact of product changes is imperative for successful product lifecycle management (PLM). But to accomplish this, manufacturing companies must be able to manage product information in complex,
        multi-dimensional environments.</p>
    <p> Unlike other PLM solutions that concentrate solely on the management of Design data, Abel takes a different approach. We believe the real benefits of PLM lies in the control of the product data, making that data easily available to people outside
        of the Design environment and the integration of that data into downstream systems and processes, such as ERP, quality management, and supply chain.</p>
    <p>Abel provides numerous benefits including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Reduced time to market</li>
        <li> Improved product quality</li>
        <li> Reduced waste and obsolete inventory</li>
        <li> Lower total cost of ownership</li>
        <li> Enhanced enterprise-wide collaboration</li>
        <li> Increased profits and market share </li>
    </ul>
