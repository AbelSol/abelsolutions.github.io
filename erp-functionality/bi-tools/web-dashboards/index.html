    <h1>Web Dashboards</h1>
    <p>Abel Web based Dashboards provide at-a-glance views of your organizations KPIs (key performance indicators) relevant to a particular objective or business process (e.g. sales, marketing, human resources, or production).&nbsp; Abel Web Dashboards give
        signs about a business letting you know something is wrong or something is right. Abel Solutions has come up with a cost effective solution that tells businesses how the organization is tracking and can highlight points of performance risk.. Abel
        dashboards show summaries, key trends, comparisons, and exceptions however they do have the capability of a driill down function. </p>
    <h2>At Abel we believe there are four key elements to a good dashboard:.</h2>

        <li> Simple, communicates easily<br> </li>
        <li>Minimum distractions...it could cause confusion<br> </li>
        <li>Supports organized business with meaning and useful data<br> </li>
        <li>Applies human visual perception to visual presentation of information</li>
