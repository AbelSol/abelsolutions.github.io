    <h1>Abel ERP Report Writer</h1>
    <p>Unlike many generic report writers, Abel ERP has been customized specifically for the database it's querying against. You don't have to tell the system how get the data; you simply tell it what you want and it will figure out how to get it. As a result,
        this product saves technical staff time and alleviates the burden of creating every query and report an end-user could ever think of. </p>
    <p>With generic report writers you are responsible for laying out fields, adjusting sizes and headings manually. Report Writer automatically places fields and headings on the report and sizes them appropriately. You can create a report in just seconds
        with only a few mouse clicks. Grouping, sorting, totaling fields, and filtering are as simple as selecting the desired option from a list. </p>
