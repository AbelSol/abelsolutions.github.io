    <h1>SQL Extraction</h1>
    <p>Abel ERP allows you to optimize applications by extracting code through Abels data dictionary. Utilizing the SQL extract requires simple business logic, even though they are neither identified or positioned as such. In Web applications, frequent interactions
        with the database can also slow down the performance of the application, whilst connections are opened and closed.</p>
    <p>Abel ERP allows users to identify source code and identify blocks of code that include database interactions. Such blocks can be isolated from any presentation logic and moved to the database layer, thus improving the operational efficiency of the
        application. Information can then be presented to any 3rd party BI tool and reporting becomes very straight forward, consistent, flexible and repeatable.</p>
    <p>The result of the service is dependent upon customer need, but can include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> A report identifying the position and size of each block;<br> </li>
        <li>Extraction of the code blocks to separate files;<br> </li>
        <li>Replacement of the code blocks with calls to database functions;</li>
    </ul>
