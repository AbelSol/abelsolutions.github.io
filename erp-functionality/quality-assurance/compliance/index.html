    <h1>Abel Quality Assurance for Manufacturing</h1>
    <p>Abel ERP Quality Testing for distribution and manufacturing oriented businesses helps automate the quality control processes and tests for serialized, lot or batch tracked inventory items as well as for non-inventory items such as environmental or
        laboratory metrics. A core strength of Abel ERP is its ability to capture relevant information and move it through the supply chain and maintain that data so that organizations know when and where their products end up.</p>
