        a range of properties that can be set for that object, including options to view or hide selected information, as well as provide filters to allow dynamic selection of data to be viewed on the desktop. A security function is provided, which enables
        you to define which users have access to each “Desktop View”. Users are then able to easily select which of the available desktops they wish to access or have loaded automatically when they log into Abel ERP. </p>
