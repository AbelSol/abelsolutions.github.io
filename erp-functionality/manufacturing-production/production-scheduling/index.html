    <h1>Production Scheduling</h1>
    <p>Some organizations require full Work Center routing and scheduling, others are content with Work Group scheduling without routes, while others do not require any scheduling. In Abel the Work Group specifies the level of scheduling required. The Work
        Center or Work Group dictates the basis of scheduling i.e. labor, machine or quantity using either Finite or Infinite processes.</p>
    <p>Each Bill of Materials contains the capacity usage information to be consumed at each work center route. Set up and clean times, fixed time per build unit and run rate per build unit are available for labor and machine. Additional scheduling information
        such as begins after previous start, begins after previous end, schedule for parallel completions, standing times, constrained position and downstream and upstream associations can also be specified within the BOM route.</p>
    <p>Abel provides a unique function for organizations wishing to schedule by work group. Labor and machine times can be specified within the structure on the BOM, and when exploded will accumulate upwards to the work group and become available for scheduling.
        Alternatively BOM Operations or Tasks can contain the labor and machine times and are exploded and accumulated as above.</p>
    <p>Work Centers can be specific or generic. As customer quotes and orders are created, Abel automatically calculates the earliest date to promise using the exploded Bill of Materials, constraint work centers and minimum times into accounting for this
        calculation.</p>
    <p>Company and Branch calendars specify working days. Default day of the week start and end times, available labor and machine hours, maximum quantities, number of employees, default crew size and the number of machines are entered against the Work Center
        and Work Group. This information may be entered as global or specified by branch. Where daily times need to be modified because of maintenance downtime, employee sickness or scheduled overtime, overrides are available for this purpose.</p>
    <p>Abelâ€™s unique scheduling process provides pick and drop positioning that incorporates variable setup times according to previously scheduled jobs and labor overlaps dependent on crew sizes. Unlike other ERP systems in use, Abel provides comprehensive
        workflow management and flexible capacity planning.</p>
