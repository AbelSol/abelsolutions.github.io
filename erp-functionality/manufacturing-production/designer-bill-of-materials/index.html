    <h1>Designer Bill Of Materials</h1>
    <p>Many organizations require a one off manufacturing process that progresses through quotations, orders then into the manufacturing production process. Multi Level Designer BOM’s are provided to satisfy this requirement. Designer BOM’s can be created
        against any production line on a customer quote, customer order or at any of the planning or production order stages. Designer BOMs can be manually loaded, created from skeleton BOMs or externally loaded from other designer software tools such
        as CAD. Full explosion of Designer BOM’s can occur at initial load time, or when the customer’s order enters the planning or production order stage. Designer BOMs incorporate the same full functionality as the standard Bill of Materials.</p>
