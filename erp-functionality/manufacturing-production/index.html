        and Plant Orders, Product Costing and Stock and Inventory Management&nbsp;functionality. For ease of planning, all sub-assemblies of task and supply chain management can be graphically exploded into a single view. All phases of work are captured
        and costed-in so you can match resource against demand and assess performance against deadlines and profitability.</p>
