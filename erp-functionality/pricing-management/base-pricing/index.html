	<h1>Base Pricing</h1>
	<p>Where it is appropriate to begin price established from a base price, then mark up or mark down to establish other pricing scenarios, a base price line can be created for this purpose. Like all other prices, the user can create multiple base prices according
		to unit size and currency. Unit size and currency conversion will occur as required.</p>
