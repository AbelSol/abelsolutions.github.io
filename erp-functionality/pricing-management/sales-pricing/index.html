	<h1>Sales Pricing</h1>
	<p>Customer or sales prices are held as base prices, branch prices, customer prices and customer category prices. Sales prices can be derived from base pricing, cost pricing, or lower level sales prices. For example, a selling price could begin with a branch
		sales price and mark it up or down according to the customers category. Sales prices are also held by unit size and currency with conversion as required. Quantity break discounting is provided which incorporates customer level pricing and specific customer
		item level pricing. Customer discount percentages and gross margin percentage is also available by providing a price level matrix for item categories or for individual items on each customer.</p>
