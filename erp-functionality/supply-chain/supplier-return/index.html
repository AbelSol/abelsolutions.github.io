    <h1>Supplier Return</h1>
    <p>The supplier return is similar to a reversed supplier delivery with the addition of the supplierâ€™s return authority number and the reason for the return. Other printed text can be attached to the document or to any of the line details. Goods may be
        returned prior to being placed into stock or following the receipt of inventory items into stock. The supplier return can be built manually, from a customer return, a supplier delivery or a purchase order. When built from a supplier delivery,
        serials, batch numbers, warehouse locations and bin locations are retained to ensure the same stock is removed from the same location for the return.</p>
