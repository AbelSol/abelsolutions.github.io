    <h1>Supplier Delivery</h1>
    <p>The purpose of a supplier delivery is to provide an inwards goods document for the warehouse receipting process. The line item details may be for inventory stocks, items purchased for manufacturing or production, or items that are to be onwards dispatched
        to customers. The supplier delivery is also used to record serials and batch numbers and provides the specific warehouse and bin location for goods going into stock. Supplier deliveries can be built manually, built from single, multiple or part
        purchase orders, or can be built as a result of an external Abel company processing a customer dispatch in the same database. (Customer dispatches in external Abel databases are handled via the inter-company invoice and transfer process). Freight
        and other goods related expenses may be added to the supplier delivery, apportioned across the line details so that goods being receipted into inventory stock or consumed by manufacturing or production or dispatched directly to customers are costed
        correctly.</p>
