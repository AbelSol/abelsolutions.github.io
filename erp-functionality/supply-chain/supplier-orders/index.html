    <h1>Supplier Orders</h1>
    <p>Supplier orders, commonly known as purchase orders, are either manually created, or automatically created from the supplier reorder process, or from customer orders that contain back-to-back requirements, or from manufacture or production orders that
        require direct raw material purchases. Like most Abel documents, purchase orders are built in local or foreign currency according to the trading arrangements with the supplier. Purchase orders can be emailed or printed.</p>
    <p>Purchase orders raised against associated internal or externally specified companies, either in the same Abel database or at a remotely located Abel database, can automatically build the resulting customer order within the supplying companyâ€™s trading
        databases.</p>
    <h2>Supplier Buffer Orders</h2>
    <p>Buffer orders are normally only used within companies that have contracted manufacturing or production responsibilities. These contracts may be short or long term, but require you to hold a minimum quantity of raw materials during the term of the
        contract. Buffer orders are usually built by exploding the Bill of Materials for the finished goods specified in the contract removing any machine or labor components. When the buffer order is posted it serves to increase the minimum and maximum
        stocking quantities used in the auto-reorder process. When the buffer order is no longer required it may be closed or removed which immediately reduces the reorder quantities appropriately.</p>
