			<h1>Capacity Requirements Planning</h1>
<p>Capacity requirements can be generated for work centers or work groups or both of these. The accuracy of the output loadings information depends on setting up the routings and labor and machine usage data on the bill of materials. Labor and machine capacity data is also entered against each work center and /or work group. Capacity loading reporting is produced from both MRP II and production scheduling and these will provide sufficient information to determine if plant constraints or capacity problems may exist.</p>
<p>Note: The capacity requirements output from MRPII is optional.</p>
