        patterns you can generate organic sales and can more effectively build campaigns to up-sell or cross-sell using filters such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Products purchased or not purchased (within a date range).</li>
        <li>Product categories purchased or not purchased (within a date range). Customer and Contact Categories</li>
        <li>Countries, States, Cities, Postcodes</li>
        <li>Account managers</li>
    </ul>
