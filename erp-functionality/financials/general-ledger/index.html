    <h2>Related Functionality</h2>
    <h3>Inter Company Accounting</h3>
    <p>As any multi-location business knows, separate locations or business units often have a very high degree of interdependence and share multiple inter-company transactions. These include buying goods for each other and also often locations transferring
        inventory, manufacturing goods, paying creditors, receiving debtor payments or paying for goods on behalf of each other.&nbsp; All these transactions require inter-company or inter-branch accounting processes. To simplify and unify this process,
        Abel provides inter-company documents (branch invoices) that are automatically produced in the host location and subsequently transferred to the remote location (branch transfers). Each document performs the correct accounting necessary to balance
        the inter-company accounts on consolidation. This includes providing for foreign currencies and different local taxation regimes. The system will auto-generate the reciprocal document at the remote location. Data accuracy is ensured and significant

    <h3>Inter-Company Documents</h3>
    <p>As any multi-location business knows, separate locations or business units often have a very high degree of interdependence and share multiple inter-company transactions. These include buying goods for each other and also often locations transferring
        inventory, manufacturing goods, paying creditors, receiving debtor payments or paying for goods on behalf of each other. All these transactions require inter-company or inter-branch accounting processes. To simplify and unify this process, Abel
        provides inter-company documents (branch invoices) that are automatically produced in the host location and subsequently transferred to the remote location (branch transfers). Each document performs the correct accounting necessary to balance
        the inter-company accounts on consolidation. This includes providing for foreign currencies and different local taxation regimes. The system will auto-generate the reciprocal document at the remote location. Data accuracy is ensured and significant
        gains can be made in productivity through time and resource saved.</p>
    <h3> Multiple Document Handling</h3>
    <p>Many businesses operating over multiple locations choose to run each location within its own dedicated database. But while this is good for maximizing processing performance, high-speed data transfers and reducing the risk of internet network outages,
        it can make getting a single view over financial performance across the whole business a challenge. Drawing on significant experience in working with manufacturing and production organizations in particular, Abel Corporate View is a unique tool
        designed to give you the best of both worlds. It allows multiple locations to run independently yet at the same time provides a consolidated financial view supported by automatic inter-database transfers. To do this, each database location synchronizes
        its general ledger account balances with a mirrored account structure in a head office database, resulting in an automatically-generated organization-wide, consolidated view of the financial accounts. In the head office system, Abel branches can
        be defined as external and be provided with database connection details enabling users (with the required credentials) to have automatic transparent access into any external branch database. To drill down into the actual data within an external
        database the user simply selects the desired branch, or performs a double-click on the summary information in the head office system. Security in the remote location database is controlled as though the user had directly signed on. Note: Consolidation
        reports across currencies use standard GAAP principles.</p>
    <h3>Multi-Currency Multi-Language</h3>
    <p>Abel ERPs allows the General Ledger of your company to be reported in a different currency, using a user-specified or bank linked exchange rate. No transactions are created by the translation process, and are available for reporting immediately. The
        General Ledger can be reflected in any of the systems currencies while still maintaining the drill down capability to transactional level. Exchange rates can reflect opening, mid and closing rates and can be updated real-time thanks to the powerful
        Abel ERP API. Even more impressively the General ledger can be translated and be in dual language so that global companies can view the same information getting the same insight at the same time regardless of the language.</p>
