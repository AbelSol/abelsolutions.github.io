    <h2>Project Accounting</h2>
    <p>Abel Project Accounting allows for projects to be accounted for inside the main financial system. This enables the business to have accountability for all projects.&nbsp;All revenues and expenses associated with a specific project can be charged to
        that project. Projects can be treated the same as any other business unit within Abel, with all the costs and revenues associated with each project fully accounted for. The financial progress of each project can be tracked and budgets and measurable
        objectives allocated in the same way you can with any other business unit. This improves the measurability and control over ongoing projects, allowing better decisions and project viability and potential throughout the life of the project.</p>

    <p>• Project costing<br>• Project budgeting<br>• Full financial accounting for projects<br>• Project within projects supported<br>• Jobs within projects are supported</p>
