    <h1>Consolidations and Translations</h1>
    <p>These days many of our customers have several different companies, businesses or branches working under the one reporting umbrella. And because important business decisions are only as good as the information they are based on, many medium-sized enterprises
        with numerous business units are struggling to get to grips with the performance of all their operations without the help of one easy and instantly usable overview. Installed within Abelâ€™s integrated ERP system, Abel Multi Company Accounting is,
        we believe, unique in being specifically developed to serve medium-sized companies. </p>
    <p>Now in use by 200 businesses across 12 countries, it is designed for companies who do not require a system developed for very large enterprises but who are also keen to escape the frustration of piecing together spreadsheets that often come with different
        reporting times, languages and currencies. Simply by selecting the reporting mode required, you can use Abel Multi Company Accounting to get a full up-to-date snapshot of all reporting information, broken down by country, currency or business
        activity. It provides for full foreign currency handling and reporting, tax sector capability and can be translatable into different end-user languages.</p>
