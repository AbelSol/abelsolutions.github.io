    <h1>Abel MRP Management</h1>
    <p>Abel’s Material Requirements Planning (MRP) is a technique which uses budgets to drive Production Planning and Inventory Control within a business. MRP can be used to plan manufacturing, purchasing and delivery activities. The system recommends re-order
        quantities and timing for materials, ensuring your supply chain is efficiently managed while maintaining low inventory levels.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Certainty For Operations</h2>
    <p> MRP gives you certainty that you have all necessary components as MRP recommends re-order quantities and timing of all the components needed to make or deliver your products, including labor loadings and machine times. MRP helps you maintain low inventory
        levels by matching supply to time-based demand from the budgets and recommends ordering the items only when they are needed, while always ensuring you have enough stock to meet anticipated demand. MRP informs you about work group / work center
        utilization by using routing and labor data in Bills of Materials to forecast factory loadings. MRP can help you build good relationships with your suppliers and customers. Using MRP recommendations, you can give your suppliers accurate forecasts
        of your purchases, helping you with price negotiations and placing you as a favored customer. Having confidence in your materials flow and pricing gives you a competitive advantage, and more certainty and accuracy in setting and meeting delivery
        times to your customers.</p>
    <h2>Better schedules means improved DIFOT</h2>
    <p>Abel’s implementation of MRP uses Budgets, Bill of Materials (BOM) and Inventory Data together with the Master Production Schedule to calculate time-phased requirements for materials. It uses the Budgets to generate recommended Order Quantities for
        Inventory Items and Production Scheduling for manufactured items. You can switch MRP on or off for individual Inventory Items and give each its own MRP production settings. Budgets used for MRP can be by product, department, customer or a combination
        of these. A scheduled MRP process uses your budgets, BOMs and inventory data to generate material requirements for staff engaged in planning and re-ordering activities.</p>
