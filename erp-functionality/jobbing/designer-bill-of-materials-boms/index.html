    <h1>Designer Bill Of Materials</h1>
    <p>Many organizations require a one-off manufacturing process that progresses through quotations, orders then into the manufacturing production process. Multi-level designer BOMs are provided to satisfy this requirement.</p>
    <p>Designer BOMs can be created against any production line on a customer quote, customer order or at any of the planning or production order stages. Designer BOMs can be manually loaded, created from skeleton BOMs or externally loaded from other designer
        software tools such as Computer Aided Design (CAD). Full explosion of designer BOMs can occur at initial load time or when the customerâ€™s order enters the planning or production order stage. Designer BOMs incorporate the same full functionality
        as the standard BOM.</p>
