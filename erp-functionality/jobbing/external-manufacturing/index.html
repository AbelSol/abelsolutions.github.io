    <h1>External Manufacturing</h1>
    <p>Abel has external manufacturing orders to account for tasks and processes which are performed by a manufacturer who is external to your manufacturing plant. These orders allow for the materials to be sent out with the job, or for a separate store
        to be held at the external site, or for the external site to supply the materials. Abel can track the costs that are added by the external manufacturer and closing the external order results in the costs being integrated into the main production
        order. External Manufacturing Orders can be scheduled as for any other type of production order.</p>
