    <h1>Nesting &amp; Batching</h1>
    <p>Nesting combines several small processes to form one larger process. Abel provides the ability to view and select combinations of work orders that can be batched together in larger processes. The Production Planner can choose any combination of work
        orders to nest together based on their sharing a commonality such as the same raw material or the same work center to create a combined final order. This functionality can significantly reduce your manufacturing costs.</p>
