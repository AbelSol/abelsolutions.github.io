    <h1>Job Costing</h1>
    <p>Job Costing is a separate work order process in which costs are collected and multiple dispatching and invoicing can occur as the job progresses. In Abel these Job Orders are typically used for repair or warranty work, and they can also be used to
        create new or modified products which are put into stock or dispatched out to a customer. The costs can be estimated on a fixed price basis or on a time and materials basis and quoted selling prices can be held for use in the invoicing process.</p>
