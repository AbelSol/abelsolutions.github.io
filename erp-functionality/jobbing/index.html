    <h1>Abel Jobbing </h1>
    <p>Manufacturing and Production processes may vary widely but all businesses share the same need to know where each process is at and whether it is making or losing them money.</p>
    <p>In developing our software Abel has tended to follow the approach of the American Production Information Control Systems (APICS) who define manufacturing as a series of interrelated activities and operations involving the design, material selection,
        planning, production, quality assurance, management and marketing of consumer and durable goods.</p>
    <p>Drawing on our experience from working with over 200 manufacturing and production businesses, Abelâ€™s ERP makes tracking complex workflows simple. It includes a full suite of Production Scheduling, Capacity Planning, Bill of Materials (BOM), Manufacturing
        and Plant Orders, Product Costing, Material Requirements Planning (MRP), Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II), and Stock and Inventory Management functionality.</p>
    <p>For ease of planning, all elements of the job including sub-assemblies, of tasks and supply chain management can be graphically exploded into a single view. All phases of work are captured and costed-in so you can match resource against demand and
        assess performance against deadlines and profitability.</p>
