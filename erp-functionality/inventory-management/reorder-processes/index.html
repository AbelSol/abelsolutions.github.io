	<h1>Reorder Processes</h1>
	<p>This incorporates Supplier Reorder, Manufacture Reorder, Manual Reorder and Branch Replenish where suggested reorder quantities are calculated to satisfy commitments and minimum inventory levels. This process considers determining factors such as:<br>•
		Minimum and maximum inventory levels<br>• Minimum and maximum days coverage<br>• Existing cover<br>• Lead times<br>• Economic and multiple order quantities<br>• Current allocations<br>• Supplier on order<br>• Goods in transit<br>• Manufacturing contract
		commitments</p>
	<p>Definable usage periods (at inventory item level) can be used to calculate the reorder quantities which may be amended prior to the auto generation of the Branch Replenishment Orders, Manufacturing Orders or Purchase Orders. Reorders can be generated
		at company, warehouse, branch or individual supplier level.</p>
