	<h1>Accurate Counts</h1>
	<p>Abel enables the Warehouse Manager to pro-actively manage inventory throughout the year using a predefined monitoring process. Inventory counts can take place periodically on a regular cyclic counting basis. Management can determine a pre-approved tolerance
		level for variations between the actual item count and what is recorded in the system. This saves heaps of time and ensures that only significant variations are dealt with allowing the distribution center to continue running smoothly without major disruption.</p>
