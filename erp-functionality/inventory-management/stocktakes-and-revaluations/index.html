	<h1>Stocktakes and Revaluations</h1>
	<p>Full, partial and cycle counting are supported. Stocktakes can be built and controlled by Bin selection, Group, or Row, to enable separate stock-take teams to count and complete each section of the warehouse. Both blind and expected count options are
		provided. As each stocktake is finalized, the necessary adjustments to the stock ledger and general ledger are posted to the appropriate accounting period. An option is available that restricts pre-stocktake transactions from being altered.</p>
	<p>Warehouse inventory can be revalued by defined selection(s) between Average Cost, Standard Cost and No Value. In addition, manual adjustments to the value of an individual inventory item may also be made. Resulting adjustments to the stock ledger and
		general ledger are posted to the appropriate accounting period.</p>
