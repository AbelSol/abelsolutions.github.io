    <h3>Systems Management</h3>
    <p>If you would like to outsource your systems management tasks, our technology partners can provide you with additional services, from systems management of your in-house Abel system through to a fully hosted solution. Our technology partners have been
        managing mission critical enterprise systems for banks, hospitals, airlines, retailers, payroll service providers, higher education providers, insurance companies and many others for over 25 years.</p>
    <h3>Backup</h3>
    <p>Abel is built on database technology that is designed to allow backups to be performed while Abel is active. Our backup utility allows you to back up your data without interrupting your business operations – even if you run 24/7. Abel’s in-built backup
        utility is tightly integrated with our database management system, ensuring that your data is kept safe and can be restored should this ever be needed. Email notifications advise you of the success or failure of your backups, providing you with
        full visibility and peace of mind that your data is safe and secure.<br></p>
