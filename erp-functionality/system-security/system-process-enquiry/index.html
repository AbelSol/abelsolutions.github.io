    <h3>System Process Enquiry</h3>
    <p>System Process Enquiry gives details of your user license utilization showing the maximum, in use and available user licenses so you can easily monitor your usage against the available concurrent user licenses. The screen also lists currently logged
        on users, so you donâ€™t have to use a database utility just to check who is logged on.</p>
    <p>This screen also shows the status of critical processes such as your Abel Outbound Email server, Scheduled Reports, Backup and any Add-Ons such as the Abel Email Plugin, so you can check that they are running.</p>
