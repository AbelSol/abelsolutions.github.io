    <h1>Web Store Fronts</h1>
    <p>Building your web store with Abel Solutions can reduce your time-to-market with several fully functional e-commerce and mobile storefronts. These "starter stores" can simplify your web store implementation. Each starter store is translated into several
        languages and support multiple Web browsers and platforms. For multiple stores for different brands, business models or geographic markets, you can manage them all from centralized marketing and merchandising tools in Abel ERP.</p>
    <p>These storefronts provide all the features, models and best practices necessary for a direct to consumer online store. Web storefronts enhance site performance, streamline the shopping experience and reduce the customization costs of a new web store.
        These storefronts offer rich capability from advanced faceted search and mini shopping carts to integrated inventory availability and product comparisons. The stores are also fully accessible and allow customers to easily switch languages and
        currencies.</p>
    <p>Integrating Abel ERP with web storefronts provides your customers with a compelling shopping experience. Customers can browse products, create wish lists, add items to their shopping cart and complete the mobile checkout process. Orders placed use
        the mobile store locator during checkout, allowing customers to pickup their items in-store when the order is ready.</p>
