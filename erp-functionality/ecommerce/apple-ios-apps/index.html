    <h1>Unique Apple Product Apps</h1>
    <p>At Abel Solutions we know how important having flexibility and easier access to data is to running your organization effectively. Abel ERP was looking for an answer that allows you to access and create offline data-entry and data-access. Abel Solutions
        design bespoke iOS (iPhone, iPad) App, which looks modern while respecting processes that are already familiar to users. This allows you to capture specific and unique information in a way that is most appropriate for your organization.</p>
    <p>Abel ERP is very customizable. Each business has a different set of business processes and documents that need to generated. Abel is configured uniquely for each and every business and as a result the app needed to be dynamic. The app had to present
        different kinds of inventory or documents without requiring a new version to be submitted to the App Store for each client. User can access get access only screens that are relevant to their business and follow the processes that they were used
        to. </p>
