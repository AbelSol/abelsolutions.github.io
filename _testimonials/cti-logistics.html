<p>We run all our financials across 27 separate business units plus a manufacturing plant on Abel. We have been really impressed in particular with the Abel Multi Company functionality. This has made inter-company transactions a breeze, significantly
    reducing our administrative overheads and importantly helped us get our accounts out a lot faster.</p>
